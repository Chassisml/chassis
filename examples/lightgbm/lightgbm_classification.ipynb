    "## Chassis Example Notebooks\n",
    "Welcome to the examples section for [Chassis](https://chassis.ml), which contains notebooks that auto-containerize models built using the most common machine learning (ML) frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Chassis?\n",
    "Chassis allows you to automatically create a Docker container from your model code and push that container image to a Docker registry. All you need is your model loaded into memory and a few lines of Chassis code! Our example bank is here to provide reference examples for many common ML frameworks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Can't find the framework you are looking for or need help? Fork this repository and open a PR, or list the desired framework in a new issue. We're always interested in growing this example bank! \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary maintainers of Chassis also actively monitor our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cHpzY9yCcM), so feel free to join and ask any questions you might have. We'll be there to respond and help out promptly."
