# Commom ML/DL Frameworks

This collection of how-to guides provides sample workflows that leverage Chassis to create containers out of your models built from the most popular ML frameworks. *NOTE: This list of frameworks is not all-inclusive.* 

Can't find the framework you are looking for? Feel free to fork this repository, add an example or two from your framework of choice, and open a PR. Or come chat with us directly on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/tdfXFY2y)**!

!!! warning "What you will need"
    To follow along with the how-to guides, you will need to install the Chassis SDK:

    ```bash
    pip install chassisml
    ```

    Additional dependencies that are example-specific will be listed on each page, respectively. If you would like to learn more about the Chassis workflow before diving in to these framework-specific examples, be sure to check out the **[Getting Started section](../../getting-started/index.md)**!

If you prefer to jump straight to the source code, check out the examples section in the Chassis GitHub repository!
