## Contributors :fontawesome-solid-code-pull-request:
We are actively looking for new contributors to join us! In particular we're already focused on the next chapter: Chassis v2.0. We have some [ambitious](https://github.com/orgs/modzy/projects/1) plans for our next major release and would eagerly accept contributions from experts in matrix math, Rust, and hardware optimization on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Also, we're happy to accept pull requests at [modzy/chassis](https://github.com/modzy/chassis).
